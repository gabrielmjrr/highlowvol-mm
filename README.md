# highlowvol-mm
Project (started July 25)

### Core Idea:

Get fair value / mid-price from high volume exchange (Bybit for example), to then quote around that on a lower volume exchange. Eventually would like to diversify the strat by also incorporating cross-exchange arb and something like a simple momentum strategy for small taker positions. 

Project is very early in its life cycle, and I am no expert: I am here to learn, showcase my progress while trying to make some money :).

### Status quo:
Workimg on bybit scraper; researching optimal pair / exchange. Exchange ideally offers rebates for posting quotes on pairs.
